## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://Tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS Framework
- [Payform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/payform) - JS Library

### What I learned

I learned the basics of Vue.js and how to create components from a single file, I also learned how to integrate Tailwind CSS together with view to be able to style in a simpler way the components, I learned how to listen and emit events and how to execute methods when an event is emitted, I learned how to validate all the inputs together with a JS library (payform).

### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about Vue.js and also how to make better responsive designs with Tailwind CSS.
